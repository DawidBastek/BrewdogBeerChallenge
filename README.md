# BrewdogBeerChallenge

### Included API tests for challenge

In order to validate the release we need the following 4 tests.
We want to validate that all the beer produced after December 2015.
- has a valid ‘abv’:
- - it must be a double
- - it must not be null
- - it must not be an empty string
- - it must be over 4.0
- has a valid ‘name’ for each beer:
- - it must not be null
- - it must not be an empty string
Two extra tests which you think should be included:
- has a valid ‘description’ for each beer:
- - it must be a string
- - it must not be null
- - it must not be an empty string
- has a valid ‘image_url’ for each beer:
- - it must not be null
- - it must not be an empty string
